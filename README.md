Final project for the course, Introduction to Machine Learning for Epidemiology

This repo includes code that was adapted from my final project for the course, Introduction to Machine Learning for Epidemiology, which I took in spring 2021 as part of my Master of Public Health. For this analysis, a synthetic dataset from the Exposome Data Challenge Event of the Helix Project (https://www.isglobal.org/-/exposome-data-analysis-challenge) was used. I constructed research questions that could be answered using these data. For Part 1, I performed an unsupervised analysis and for Part 2, I performed a supervised analysis.
